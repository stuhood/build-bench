# Contributions

I welcome anyone who wants to add something.

Open tasks:

* Parsing the output of time and generating pretty reports / graphs (use time -o -f, then collect results)
* sbt using junit 4.12
* Add skeletton build files to arbitrary projects with flat parent/submodule structure. Possibly define meta-buildsystem with hooks.
* Simple tweaks for individual buildsystems (they should remain realistic)
* templated configuration of builds (java version, dependencies)
* Integrate other tools (checkstyle, Findbugs, PMD)
* Integrate other test frameworks (Testng, spock)
* interesting scalable generated sources
* optionally run tests/tasks in parallel using n CPUs
* Refactor Buildsystem knowledge in declarative way, allowing to easily benchmark multiple versions of same buildsystem, same buildsystem with different options, ...
* sanitized contained envs (PATH, CLASSPATH, PYTHONPATH, RUBY, *_HOME, virtualenv, .cache)
* draw sequence diagram of Makefilebuild
* allow local installs instead of downloaded
* configure apache download mirror centrally
* Make Makefile subdirectories self-sustaining (global includes file)
