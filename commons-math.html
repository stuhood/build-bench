  <h1>Sample Results for Commons-Math</h1>
    <p>Compile and Tests, single-module project, 4 CPU laptop, as measured by GNU time. The value shown is the real (wall clock) time spend on the process, and the user-space CPU time (sum over all CPUs). The system-space CPU time was negligeable.</p>

    Sbt is quickest, but cheating, it does not run all tests. Overall the other buildsystems doing parallelization show that on this hardware you cannot get below 140 seconds. Surprisingly pants took more time. This might be related to the great number of file operations.

    Some buildsystems do not show any user CPU time, I assume this to be due to using separate daemon threads to do some work like nailgun.

<p>Several buildsystems recognize there is nothing to do, surprisingly pants is not among them.<p>

As a possible explanation for pants build times, here are the numbers of file system input and outputs as reported by GNU time for the clean builds. Again, some buildsystems show zero because of the limitations of GNU time. Still you can see that pants does a lot of file IO compared to the other systems.
