  <h1>Sample Results for Commons-Math</h1>
    <p>Compile and Tests, single-module project, 4 CPU laptop, as measured by GNU time. The value shown is the real (wall clock) time spend on the process, and the user-space CPU time (sum over all CPUs). The system-space CPU time was negligeable.</p>

  <h2>Clean build from scratch</h2>

    Sbt is quickest, by using all CPUs to the ullest. During the test, my system became unusable, the mouse crawling over the screen like a snail. Overall the other buildsystems doing parallelization show that 140 seconds is a reasonable number while keeping the system usable. Surprisingly pants took more time. This might be related to a great number of file operations (bootstrap time was not measured).

    <p>
    Some buildsystems do not show any user CPU time, I assume this to be due to using separate daemon threads to do some work like nailgun.

  <h2>Rebuild without changes</h2>

<p>Several buildsystems recognize there is nothing to do, surprisingly pants is not among them.<p>

    <h2>Clean build file Ops</h2>

As a possible explanation for pants build times, here are the numbers of file system input and outputs as reported by GNU time for the clean builds.
